Preliminary exam in statistics

UW-Madison Statistics Department 2016-2017 handbook <http://www.stat.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/2016-17%20Complete%20PDF%20Handbook.pdf> says the following:

> 3. Preliminary Examination
>
> The student must pass an oral preliminary examination on a topic selected with the approval of the student’s advisor. The examination is given by a committee of at least four faculty members
appointed by the advisor. Prior to the actual examination, the student must prepare a 15 to 20 page paper outlining the area to be covered. The paper must be written in a clear style with consistent
notation. The paper should indicate the scope and depth of the student’s dissertation research, and should be submitted to the committee at least one week prior to the examination.
The examination typically consists of a 20 to 30 minute talk by the student and questions by the committee. The committee may ask questions during and after the talk. The student may consult notes, but is expected to display a mastery of the subject matter as defined by the list of references.
The scope of the questions will normally be directed to the subject matter of the paper but may, by natural extension, include any relevant topic. The student’s advisor may not serve as chair of the committee, but does appoint the chair.
At least three weeks before the scheduled Preliminary Examination, students should contact the graduate coordinator, who will request a preliminary warrant from the Graduate School. Upon review, the Graduate School will return the warrant to the Graduate Coordinator for committee members to sign after the examination.
