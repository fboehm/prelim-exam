We will develop methods for distinguishing pleiotropy from close linkage in model organism quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies. We first survey the relevant statistical and scientific literature before discussing our pilot studies in which we demonstrate feasibility of our research strategy. We continue with detailed discussion of proposed studies and their potential impact on subsequent research.
