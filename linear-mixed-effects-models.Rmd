# Linear mixed effects models

Univariate models of each quantitative trait identified initial loci of interest. The models were fitted via restricted maximum likelihood methods. Karl Broman has implemented these methods in the R/qtl2scan and related packages.

The model that we use is 

$Y = X\beta + \epsilon$

where $Var (\epsilon) = \sigma^2_g K + \sigma^2_e I$
where $K$ is a known kinship matrix and $I$ is the identity matrix.
